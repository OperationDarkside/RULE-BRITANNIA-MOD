# RULE BRITANNIA MOD
## A Rome 2: Total War Mod for an overpowered Iceni faction

You DON'T want any challenge and just conquer the world without lifting a finger? Then this mod is for you.

Play as the Iceni on the British Isles and smash the competition with your famous english longb.. I mean Briton Slingers.

Imagine Robin Hood in full chainmail, with a twohander, times 150, who ownes a yacht. That's the kind of experience you can expect.

EDIT: The "caboom.pack" does what it says. It'll rock your graphics card so hard, that if you're too close the game will commit Sudoku.

Remember: Cool guys don't look at explosions
